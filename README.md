# Boat-Optimizer
Custom app I built for my position at my sailing club to resolve scheduling conflicts and optimize equipment use.

This app works by firstly adding all of the sails that will be going out and boat type. It then identifies which boats would be the optimal boats for that sail. It includes things like sail length and boat location in the mooring field. It then creates a boat use schedule which reflects that. It might also consider schedules a human wouldn't have thought of, and will definitively identify if a schedule is impossible.
